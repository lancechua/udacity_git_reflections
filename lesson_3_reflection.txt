When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you have to collaborate with other people, or when you are using multiple devices (laptop, desktop,...)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might not want to show changes to the public, or you might not want to integrate changes made by others yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork will clone a github repository within github. Used when you are building off someone else's work
    Clone will create a copy of a repository locally, whether from GitHub or also locally. Used when you want to copy something
    Branches are used to make different versions of the same file/s within the same repository. Used when you want to try something out

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Allows you to work offline then just merge changes when you have access to an internet connection.
